# 🔑 GITHUB UPLOAD - NEED YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN

## The GitHub account shows as suspended when using git push.

Let's try uploading via GitHub API instead!

---

## STEP 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. **Note**: `Upload StructCrew`
4. **Expiration**: 30 days
5. **Select scopes** - Check these:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (starts with `ghp_`)

---

## STEP 2: Give Me the Token

Once you have the token, paste it here and I'll upload all files to:
**https://github.com/yashrakhiani/sc-cloud**

## ALTERNATIVE: Manual Upload via Web

If the API doesn't work, you can upload via GitHub web interface:

### Option A: Upload Files One by One
1. Go to: https://github.com/yashrakhiani/sc-cloud
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Drag and drop all your project files
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Option B: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com
2. Clone the repo
3. Copy all your files into it
4. Commit and push

---

## 🎯 WHICH OPTION?

1. **API Upload** (I do it for you) - Need token
2. **Manual Web Upload** (You do it) - 5 minutes
3. **GitHub Desktop** (You do it) - 10 minutes

**What would you prefer?** 🚀
