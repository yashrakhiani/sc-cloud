Subject: Affordable Recruitment Solutions for {{COMPANY_NAME}}

Hello,

I noticed your recent job posting on @archijobs, and I wanted to reach out.

My name is Yash Rakhiani, and I run StructCrew - a boutique recruitment agency specializing in the Architecture & Design industry in Delhi.

I understand that finding the right talent can be time-consuming and expensive. Traditional agencies charge 15-20% of annual salary, which adds up quickly when you're trying to build a team.

Here's how StructCrew is different:

✓ Flat-fee pricing (50% below traditional agencies)
✓ AI-powered candidate screening (faster turnaround)
✓ Expertise across all levels (junior designers to senior architects)
✓ Local Delhi market knowledge

We've successfully placed candidates for studios like Urban Mistrii, Hookkapaani, and Melange Studio.

If you're currently hiring or expect to hire in the next few months, I'd love to discuss how we can help you find the right people without the traditional agency overhead.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call?

Best regards,

Yash Rakhiani
